I would characterise their aura as high tempo as the majority of their top 100 songs are over 100 bpm

This calculation may no be accurate or representative of the listener as it only takes into account one aspect of the songs data.
Ideally, we would look at all the data and use it in conjuction to find a more suitable "aura" for the listener.
