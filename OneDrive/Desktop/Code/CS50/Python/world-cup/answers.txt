Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

With a small number of simulations, certain teams, e.g. Switzerland were given a high probability
to win, with this probability falling the more simulations were run.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 (ten thousand) simulations,
so I would call this "good enough" to avoid
the 849ms runtime of 100000 (one hundred thousand) simulations.
